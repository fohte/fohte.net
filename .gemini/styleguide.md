## DO NOT suggest

- Changing versions or editions specified in config files

Assume version choices are intentional. Your training data may be outdated.

## Code comment rules

Comments must explain non-obvious WHY, not WHAT. Well-named identifiers already describe what the code does.

### Write only stock information

A comment must carry information that stays true for the lifetime of the code: a non-obvious WHY, an invariant, an external constraint (spec, protocol, hardware quirk), or a workaround tied to a specific upstream bug. If a future reader could delete the comment without losing context, it should not exist.

### Do not write flow information in code comments

Flow information — change history, alternatives that were considered and rejected, review feedback, "previously we did X / now we do Y", or links kept purely as a record of past decisions — belongs in commit messages and PR descriptions, not in source files. Code comments are read out of chronological context and rot as the code evolves.

A link to a PR or issue is fine when it documents an _active_ external constraint the reader needs right now: an upstream bug being worked around, a tracking issue for a TODO, an RFC the code conforms to. The test is whether the link still helps explain the current code; if it only records "this is how we got here", it is flow information and belongs in the commit log.

```bash
# bad: history and rationale that belongs in the PR / commit log
# Background:
#   When we put the terraform plugin cache on actions/cache, old providers
#   accumulate every time the lock file is updated. GitHub's 7-day LRU is
#   per primary key so daily touches keep stale entries alive forever.
#   We considered relying on Terraform's built-in cleanup but it does not
#   exist, so we delete unpinned providers ourselves before save.
prune_unpinned_providers

# good: only the non-obvious WHY that the reader needs at this line
# Terraform has no built-in cache cleanup, so prune providers absent from
# the current lock files before actions/cache save to bound cache size.
prune_unpinned_providers
```

### Do not copy task / issue / PR background into code comments

Do not paste the "background" or "context" section of a task instruction, GitHub issue, or PR description into a source file as a header comment. That text exists in the PR description and commit message already; duplicating it in code creates two copies that drift and forces future readers to re-read context that is not needed to understand the code itself. A `Usage:` block or a one-line WHY at the relevant call site is enough.
