# Introduction

This is a basic test post created specifically for visual regression testing. It contains standard blog post elements to ensure consistent rendering.

## Main Content

Here's a paragraph with some **bold text** and _italic text_ for testing inline styles. We also have `inline code` to verify monospace font rendering.

### Subsection with List

- First list item
- Second list item with longer text to test wrapping
- Third list item

### Code Example

```javascript
// Test code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}

greet('VRT Test')
```

## Conclusion

This concludes our basic VRT test post. All standard elements should render correctly.
